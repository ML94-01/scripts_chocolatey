Install Instructions & Troubleshooting

1. go to either the "chocoUpdate" or "chocoInstall" folder 
2. right click on the trigger.bat file in the folder, and click on "Run as Admin"
3. Let the installs finish; this may take 20-30 minutes.
4. If you see a bunch of red text during the initial install, Chocolatey didn't install cleanly.
5. Go to the "chocoFix" folder and run the "choco_fix_trigger.bat" file ONE TIME ONLY, then try the "choco_install_trigger.bat" file again.
6. Logs of what has been done are located at C:\\"your username"\Documents; if you want troubleshooting help, attach the log file to a message. 
7. Refer back to the Class 6 install document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ERPPJxKwzxhQ0RXWoZDj1-1FylsTvPjPqae6UTqDhZI/edit?usp=sharing) when the installs are finished (aka when the PowerShell or Command Prompt window disappears).
